## Indic Keyboard
AOSP keyboard ported to support more languges.


Indic keyboard is a native free and open source Indian language input keyboard application for Android mobile devices. At present supporting almost 15 Indic languages, this application uses fonts in Android system in both direct input (characters mapped to keys) and transliteration.

The app supports any device which has Android 4.1 and above installed.
