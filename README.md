## Indic Keyboard
AOSP keyboard ported to support more languges.


Indic keyboard is a native free and open source Indian language input keyboard application for Android mobile devices. At present supporting almost 15 Indic languages, this application uses fonts in Android system in both direct input (characters mapped to keys) and transliteration. Though support for Indian languages was already available in some phones, Android officially started support with Jelly bean (4.1) version.

Users can directly type in their native language to any app installed in their phone. An installation wizard is included with the app to ease the setup process. Any novice user can install and setup the app for their language easily.
This app extends Androidâ€™s default keyboard and adds support for languages such as Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sinhalese, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu. The app supports any device which has Android 4.1 and above installed. Most of the supported languages have 3 layouts - phonetic, inscript and transliteration.Do note that font support for all languages may not be available in all makes and models.
